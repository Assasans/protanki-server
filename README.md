# ProTanki Server

> [!WARNING]
> **Please note that this project no longer maintained.**
>
> This server does not support clients with version higher than `library-20221001-223140` (protocol update).
> The client becomes more and more obfuscated, whch makes it impossible to analyze the new protocol and almost any other changes.
>
> Instead, an open source server for the official Tanki Online client â€“ [Narukami](https://github.com/NarukamiTO/server) is available.
>
> Latest supported client version (without resources) is available on the [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20220929113606/http://s2.protanki-online.com/library.swf).
