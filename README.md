## Unmaintained

**Please note that this project no longer maintained.**

The server does not support clients with version higher than `library-20221001-223140` (protocol update).
The client becomes more and more obfuscated, whch makes it impossible to analyze the new protocol and almost any other changes.
At this point it is easier to make a server for the official Tanki Online client than for ProTanki (see [Araumi](https://araumi.org)).

Latest supported client version (without resources) is available on the [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20220929113606/http://s2.protanki-online.com/library.swf).
